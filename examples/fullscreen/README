helper.py contains a few helper function for running an experiment:
    * getId(path = ".", filename = 'id.lst', condition = True)

        o  *filename* name of the file
        o  *condition* Should a condition be returned or just a number

    * writeTrials(header, list, path, expName, id, sep = "\t", part = '', 
       extension = '.rtd', mode = 'w', print_header = True)
        (write a list of dictionanaries with the same keys to the specified path.)

    * writeDemographics(header, list, path, expName, id, sep = "\t", part = '', 
       extension = '.rtd', mode = 'w', print_header = True)
       (write a list of dictionanaries with the same keys to the specified path.)

    * writeDemographics(header, dict, path, expName, id, condition, sep = "\t", 
       extension = '_demographics.dat', mode = 'a')
